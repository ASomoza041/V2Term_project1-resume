        <p>
            As of right now, I've never had an actual job due to time restraints. However, the coding program at
            West-Mec (see "<a href="education.html">Education</a>")
            prepares me for a life of work after the program. That class teaches students HTML, CSS, and next year, we
            will be learning JavaScript code. While the class teaches us about code, it also teaches us good leadership
            skills and proper work etiquette.
