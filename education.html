            One of the two schools I'm attending is West-Mec. Monday-Friday I travel to West-Mec's central campus and
            take part in the coding program. In the coding program students are taught the history of code and how to
            code/design/program websites. We learn all the rules and techniques to designing/programming a web page by
            experts in the field.
        </p>

            The other of the two schools I attend is Moon Valley High School where I'm taught by experienced teachers.
            At that
            campus I learn the basics such as math, reading, history, etc. At that school I try to go above and beyond,
            taking honors and AP classes if I think I could be succsessful.
