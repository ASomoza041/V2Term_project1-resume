            One of the two schools I'm attending is West-Mec. Monday-Friday I travel to West-Mec's central campus and
            take part in the coding program. In the coding program students are taught the history and how code is
            created. We learn all the rules and techniques to designing/programming a web page by experts in the field.
        </p>

            The other of the two schools I attend is Moon Valley High School where I'm taught by experienced teachers.
            At that
            campus I learn the basics such as math, reading, history, etc. At that school I try to go above and beyond,
            taking honors and AP classes if I think I could be succsessful.
