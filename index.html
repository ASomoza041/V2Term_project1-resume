        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Alex Somoza and if you're reading this, chances are you are intreresting in
            learning more about me. When I'm not working on my new found love for code, you'll usually find me reading
            some of my
            favorite works of literature such as <i>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i> or the graphic novel series
            <i>Bone</i>. I
            also enjoy
            playing video games on my spare time or listening to music. Music has always had a large effect on my life.
            I've had 4 years of experience playing the violin. Nowadays I prefer to listen to the music, not make it.
