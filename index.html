        <p>
            My name is Alex Somoza and if you're reading this, chances are you are intreresting in
            learning more about me. When I'm not working on my new found love for code, you'll usually find me reading
            some of my
            favorite works of literature such as <i>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i> or the graphic novel series
            <i>Bone</i>. I
            also enjoy
            playing video games, listening to music, or playing chess on my spare time. Music has always had a large
            effect on my life.
            I've had 4 years of experience playing the violin. Nowadays I prefer to listen to the music, not make it.
